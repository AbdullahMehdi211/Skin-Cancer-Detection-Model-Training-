# Skin-Cancer-Detection-Model-Training-
This project focuses on training a deep learning model to detect skin cancer from medical images. The goal is to leverage machine learning techniques to classify images into malignant and benign categories, assisting in early detection and diagnosis.

Features:

Data Preprocessing: Image normalization, augmentation, and dataset splitting for better model generalization.
Deep Learning Model: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) trained to classify skin lesions.
Performance Metrics: Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualization: Model loss, accuracy graphs, and confusion matrix for better insight into training performance.

Technologies Used:

Python

TensorFlow / Keras

OpenCV

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib / Seaborn

How to Use:

Install Dependencies:
pip install tensorflow numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn opencv-python
Run the Notebook: Execute the Jupyter Notebook step by step to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate performance.
Dataset: Ensure you have a dataset of skin lesion images (e.g., HAM10000) before running the training.

Results:

The trained model achieves high accuracy in distinguishing between malignant and benign skin lesions, demonstrating the potential of AI in medical diagnosis.

Future Improvements:

Enhance dataset size for better generalization.
Optimize model architecture for improved accuracy.
Deploy as a web or mobile application for real-world use.
